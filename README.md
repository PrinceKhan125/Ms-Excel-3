# Ms-Excel-3

The reason for me using the "Book 4.xlsx" is basically to showcase my work that I did through MS EXCEL.
It is showcasing my Documentation and the Data tab to represent what each country's share of CO2 is in 2020.
Plus the documentation which will help guide the reader make a conclusion between the table and the chart.

The reason for me using the "task2_sources.txt" is basically for demonstrating that no information that is in
the EXCEL is false. Thus, including the URL of the sites visited.

The screenshots are used as a tool to show the admin that everything is according to the guideline.
Thus respecting all rules and showcasing that all files were successfully commited.
